## Mathematical Analysis

The Vigenere Cipher is very difficult to crack without the code but it isn't impossible.

## Decrypting without a key

The simplest method is a brute force attack but the longer the word, the harder it get because there are 26 to the power of the word length combinations. 

The less conventional methods are much more difficult to do and involve lots of letter frequency, and identifying patterns in the sequence.
