# Final Analysis
* Why did this stop being a useful code?
  * The Vigenere Cipher is no longer useful because it can be quite easy to break. Because the cipher can only have a key that is a certain length a brute force attack can be applied and actually be efficient. Once a person guesses the correct length of the key, they can just break up the text into smaller parts and attempt to decrypt the text using methods similar to breaking a Caesar Cipher.  
* What made it useful when it was being used?
  * The Vigenere Cipher was useful when it was being used becuase it was thought of as an unbreakable cipher. Because letters that were repeated in the original message would be encrypted with different characters with the cipher it made it much harder for the average person to break this cipher. So to summarize, even if a letter appears often in the original message once it is encrypted the cipher will reduce the amount of times the letter is used by encrypting it with different characters. 
* What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?
  * The Vigenere Cipher is somewhat similar to the Caesar Cipher. However, Vigenere is much more secure that the Ceasar Cipher because it redueces the amount of times characters are repeated. 
  * The Vigenere Cipher was actually used in the American Civil war. A Vigenere disk was created and used by the Confederates.
