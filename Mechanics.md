## Mechanics
The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using polyalphabetic substitution. Polyalphabetic substitution is when a cipher uses different letters to substitute for one letter. It is a symmetric cipher because the key is used to encrypt and decrypt the text.

### Example

Text: CYBERSECURITY

Keyword (DOG): DOGDOGDOGDOGD

Note - The keyword repeats for the length of the text.

Encrypted word: FMHHFYHQAUWZB
